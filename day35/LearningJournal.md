So about today topic we talk about graphs and how to implement them and credit and the difference between the graphs and the other data structure.
So the main difference between a graph and let's say trees that is the trees is linear without a cycle and the graphs non-linear with that maybe has a cycle .
We divided the graph depending on the link between the notes to some groups or some types
1.depend on the how many nodes linked with the other node 
a- complete
b- connected
C- disconnected

2. If cycle or acyclic
a- cycle
b- acyclic
3. To be the edge in one way or two way
a- Directed 
b- Undirected
After that we'll talk about how to describe the graph in the code 
We have two way 
1.Adjacency Matrix
2.Adjacency List

One of the most important things that we added to the match at the graph that makes it more usable is to make the graph Weighted Graphs I'm definitely for every age have a width with a number in this way we can find the best way or the best thing and how to find the shortest way between the edges and use it and we use this way in many things in real life like GPS and navigation systems
