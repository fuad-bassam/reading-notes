# Learning Journal
So for today work we learn about something new called razor pages it is to build dynamic pages quicker and more control and efficacy from two part we put the function and the methods on it(work as 'controller') and the other part is part with 'cshtml' extension (work as 'view') .

And then we took about the difference between 'MVC'  and 'Razor pages'

----|----
Have three parts (model-view-controler)|have two parts (file.cshtml and file.cshtml.cs)
Can the controllers have actions that not related to the view|every thinks in the page model class related to the view template
