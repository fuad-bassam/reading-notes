So for today we work on the view component
And what we need it for and how to use it in dotNet core.
view component is a view page that is part of another view page like a Partial page but more powerful and flexible, also the way that deals with it the view component **isn't** part of the HTTP request.


We use the view component when we want part of the page to have data that is not related to HTTP request or that data formated on the outside page and shown in a specific part in the page like :
`cart cont`,`some data for the users`,`some part for adds`.


For the way to use it we took about it [here](./ViewComponents.md)
