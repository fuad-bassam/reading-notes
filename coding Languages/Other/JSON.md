# JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format.

Here are the key points about JSON:

1. Data Format: JSON represents data as key-value pairs, similar to objects in JavaScript,including **strings**, **numbers**, **booleans**, **arrays**, and **objects inside it**.

2. Syntax: JSON uses a simple and intuitive syntax, consisting of braces `{}`, square brackets `[]`, colons `:`, and commas `,`. Data is organized into name-value pairs within curly braces, and arrays are represented by square brackets.

3. Language Independence: JSON is a language-independent format, widely used in different programming languages. It is not tied to any specific language or platform, making it versatile and compatible across systems.

4. Data Exchange: JSON is commonly used for data exchange between web browsers and servers. It serves as a lightweight alternative to XML, allowing for efficient data transmission over networks.

5. Readability: JSON's syntax is easy for humans to read and write, which aids in its widespread adoption. Its simplicity makes it accessible to developers and facilitates debugging and troubleshooting.

6. Widely Supported: JSON is supported by most modern programming languages and has extensive support in various libraries and frameworks. It is natively supported in JavaScript through the `JSON` object.

7. Web APIs: JSON is commonly used as the data format for web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It allows clients to request and receive data from servers in a structured and standardized manner.

8. Security: JSON is a safe and secure data format, as it only represents data and does not contain executable code. However, it's important to properly validate and sanitize JSON data received from untrusted sources to prevent security vulnerabilities.
