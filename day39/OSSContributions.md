OSS Contribution-Tracker is a tool that tracks external contributions to third-party open source software and CLAs that are sometimes associated.

Definition of Contributions
Contributions are "more than just code" and are often times hard to measure. Our team tries to start with a small subset and update this section over time.

Source Code
Documentation
Tutorials and blog posts
Workshops and trainings
Issue discussion, resolving bugs and suggesting feature design/architecture
Package and release distribution
Help on community forums and social media
Resource and Time Dedication
Developer Evangelists are encouraged to find time every week for Open Source contributions.

Measurement
We aim to measure this in the form of submitted issues, MR/PRs and commit URLs where applicable.
