the first thing is that the stack mean linked list in specific condition that meak us deal with the top node just `FILO`.


like in real life when we get a stack of book sorted above eath other if we want to add book on this books we add it above the other and if we need any book we need to remove it from top book by book `add and remove from top`.

and we take about fore method we use it with Stacks

   - Method `push` to add element in the stack.
   - Method `pop` to return and remove from the stack.
   - Method `peek` to return the value of the top of the stack **first element**.
   - Method `isEmpty` to check if the Stack is null or not.
    



## Queue

then we take about other thing that the queue and his specific condition that meak us add in last and take from first `FIFO`.


like in real life when we take about line of wating pepole in any market or games .... ,that the first prpole in line take the first place for shoping playing `out the first from the line`.
