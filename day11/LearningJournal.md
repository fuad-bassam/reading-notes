    -> `server`(end point) 
       -> some `comfegration` 
           -> `controller` -> (the controller depend on the request decide what model we use ) `model`(model request data from `database`)
               -> (send data that we requer) `controller`
                     -> (controllar ask view to generate view depend on data from the model) `view` 
                        -> return from all this to retch web browser.
