so we take `hashing` and `hash tables` 
## hashing 

in general hash is similar to encryption with encrypted the data BUT the main deferent between them is the encryption that has the ability to return the data to it plane statute and the hash don't. 

and why we using hashing, because it helps accelerate the process and it is much easier and faster to find an item using it hashed key   
then we take about 
## hash tables

the hash table is list, table or array of hashed value that we get it by it hashed value.  

this hash table has different ways to decide the right place to store data using hashed key that they have, and depending in these ways and the space that we gave to the hash table that maybe we get to data in the same place and that what we call it `Collision` 


And there is may ways to deal with the Collision
1. replace the data: in that way we remove the previous date and replace it with the new data 
2. make both in the same place: in this way we make the place a linked list for data and add the new data to this linked list
