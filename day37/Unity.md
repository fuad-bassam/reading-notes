# Unity

Unity is a platform release in 2005 used to develop 2D and 3D video games and simulations using C# for each platform.  

there is many game engine like:
1. game maker studio2 
2. scratch
3. frostbite 3
4. unreal engine
5. unity

and we chose unity because it is in the middle its not small engine like `scratch` or hard and too complicated like `unreal engine` 

# In unity

every game object has:
1. mesh: to define the shap of the object 
2.  mesh rendered: to define the material that object made form and the lights
3. physics: to define the actual physics that the object has like gravity
4. make c# class that inherits this object to customise and add more features

the interface of unity engine is composed of:
1. the scene: that have how the game look like for to angular `third person and  `first person` and have the sun to represent how the light looks like 
2. the hierarchy: that have the layers and all objects 
3. the inspector: that have the property of the selected object
4. the project: have the project folders locations and thing that we import to the project
5. the console: that works the same as regular console in the project folder bath
