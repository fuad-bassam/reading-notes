# Testing API and Swagger
## Swagger 
---
first of all we take about Swagger which is  NuGet Package that we use to document the endpoint in the code and we take about why we use it ,it's for
1. saving time and effort 
2. have a good powerful document in our code 
3. give the oner or the end user what to see with the data response is without seeing the code.

and we can add in many ways after we add the package [Way1](https://github.com/LTUC/amman-401d1-dotnet/blob/main/class-17/resources/swagger-quickstart.md)
, [Way2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-swashbuckle?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio)

## Testing API 

so for testing we take about why testing in code is important for like `save time and effort, `make us more comfortable on the code` ... etc.
then we take about testing the controller in our code using Unit test to test the behavior and the expected response in this controller.

and there are steps to make this Unit testing you can find it [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/testing-and-debugging/unit-testing-controllers-in-web-api)
