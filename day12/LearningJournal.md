so today we first take about `Entity Framework` and what it is.
Entity Framework: this is the way we use it to sort and map our code for using data from the database and it automatically converted statements to basic code in run time.

Then we take about how to start a new empty `ASP.net core empty` inside this project we edit some parts from the code ad we add
- `Data` folder that has the main context of the database 
- then we create `models` folder that has every entity in our ERD.
- then we create `controllers` folder that route URL as APIs to route using data
