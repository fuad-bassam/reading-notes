# Learning Journal

so today 13/3 the first day in the advanced course 


today we learn about many thing 
1. the mean different between the javascript and c# that is 
 - javascript : is interpreted language  (it run line by line )(if there is error it will skep the line and  continue working
- C# : compiled language  (it run all bloke at once ) (if there is an error it will not work)
2. classes and object :
 the classes is the blueprint for building object and how the object   behavior .
the object is the instance of class 
** if we want to create a method for class we add "static"
**we cant deal C# without classes
  
3. the data type in c# :( `byte`, `float`, `double,int` , `short` , `long`, `char`,`bool`,`String`)

-  Rolls 
 if we want to convert from smaller type to biger type  it will auto convert ,but the opposite need casting ( `(int)` , ` Convert.ToInt32()` )


4.  error handling : we took about what is debuting , and try/catch and error handling

we use try/catch to get the error in CLR and we deal with this error in catch using error handler .
