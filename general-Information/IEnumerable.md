## **yield**

---

yield is what we can call it lazy iterator, that does not create the data directly but just create what we need.  
we use yield return in data collection with very large number of data to improve our code performance.

what yield do is to not create data and then assign it all to variable it just **create and return fields (data) when we want it** one by one. 


we usually use yield with IEnumerable.
